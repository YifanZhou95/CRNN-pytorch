The code require [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [CTCLoss](https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc/tree/pytorch_bindings/pytorch_binding)

To install CTCLoss library on ieng6 cluster, refer to [Install_CTCLoss_on_ieng6.md](Install_CTCLoss_on_ieng6.md)

To use CTCLoss library, refer to [CTCLoss_Tutorial.md](CTCLoss_Tutorial.md)
